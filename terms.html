        <h1>Terms & Conditions</h1>
        <h2>1.Payday Fantasybook</h2>
        <p>Payday Fantasybook is the brand of Forinit Tech Private Limited ("Payday Fantasybook"). The Payday
            Fantasybook app offers sports-based online fantasy games. Payday Fantasybook as used herein shall be
            construed as a collective reference to Payday Fantasybook platforms and the Payday Fantasybook app.
        <h4> Legal Disclaimer for U.S. Fantasy Sports Participants</h4>
        <p> Fantasybook offers fantasy sports contests that are designed to comply with applicable U.S. laws and
            regulations, including the Unlawful
            Internet Gambling Enforcement Act (UIGEA). Participation is permitted only in states and jurisdictions where
            such fantasy contests are
            legal</p>
        <p>do not permit participation from users in states where fantasy sports contests are restricted or prohibited
            by law. It is the sole
            responsibility of each user to determine whether they are eligible to participate based on their local laws.
            Users must be 18 years or older
            (or the minimum age in their jurisdiction, if higher) to register and participate.</p>
        <p> By entering any contest, users affirm that they meet all eligibility requirements and are participating in
            compliance with all applicable laws.
            Payday Fantasybook reserves the right to restrict, suspend, or terminate access to the platform for any user
            found to be in violation of
            these requirements</p>
        <h4>Game of Skills</h4>
        <p>It is imperative to understand that the Payday Fantasybook app is solely based on the game of skills, not a
            game of chance(s).</p>
        <h4>Why Payday Fantasybook is game of Skills?</h4>
        <p>Payday Fantasybook is considered a game of skill because it involves users creating virtual teams based on
            real players and their performance in actual sports events. Participants use their knowledge of the game,
            players' statistics, and strategic decision-making to form teams that they believe will perform well in a
            given match. The outcome is determined by the real-world performance of the chosen players during the match,
            making it a skill-based game rather than one purely based on chance.</p>
